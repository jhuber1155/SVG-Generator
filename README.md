# SVG-Generator

## Description

This project was meant to show us how to use export modules, classes and inheritance, as well as learning how tests are used to help our code work properly. I built this project to better understand how to interconnect a series of files which depend on each other to complete a task, in this case, creating an svg logo. This type of thinking allows me to better understand interconnectivity of files and programs as I go on to learn about servers and modularization.

## Installation

Go to Github and clone the repository.

Open the repository with your preferred code editor.

## Usage

Open the file marked index.js in your preferred code editor and then right click on the index.js file to open the integrated terminal. Once in the terminal, run the command `node index.js`. That will then prompt you with a series of questions on what you would like your logo to look like. After answering all the questions, the finished logo.svg file will be created in the examples folder. Open the examples folder and then right click on the file labeled "logo.svg". Then select preview SVG to see your new logo!

## Credits

I would like to thank the instructors and students of the UCLA bootcamp as well as the the X-pert learner program which the bootcamp provides. With their help I was able to generate the code you see in this repository.
